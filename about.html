                        <h2>About P. S. Davis</h2>
            
                        <p>P. S. Davis is a fantasy author currently based in Sweden, known for crafting immersive, literary worlds
                            grounded in realism, grit, and emotional stakes. He is the author of <em>The Seeker’s Wrath</em> and the

                        <p>His writing blends grounded historical textures with a relentless focus on human conflict, and he’s
                            deeply committed to tactical realism, character nuance, and emotional authenticity. His fantasy is never
                            fluffy, always lived-in.</p>
            
                        <p>When he’s not writing, he’s tinkering with websites, designing maps, or helping other indie authors

                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>What drew you to fantasy specifically?</h3>
                    <p>When I was fourteen, we were given a project in English class to write a story. I wrote a full fantasy epic
                        and got an A. My teacher wrote, and I’ll never forget it: “This is just like Tolkien. It’s fantastic!” That
                        was the moment something clicked. I'd already been imaginative, building worlds and stories. I was the kind
                        of kid who played Dungeons & Dragons at thirteen and created my own maps and quests. Growing up doesn’t mean
                        growing out of fantasy—it means reshaping it. Some stories stopped feeling real to me. Even though I love
                        dragons, they began to feel overpowered and implausible. I wanted a world where magic existed, but reality
                        still mattered. That’s Teloshka. It’s as grounded as Earth, but with a layer of the unknown you can live in
                        through the prose.</p>

                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>When did you first call yourself a writer?</h3>
                    <p>I still don’t. I love writing, but I’ve never said, “I’m a writer.” I just get the words out of my head and
                        hope someone else connects with them. For me, writing is a relief. Once the ideas are on paper, I feel free
                        of them. That’s what matters most.</p>
                </article>
            
                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>What would surprise readers about your background?</h3>
                    <p>I have a bachelor’s degree in Environmental Physics and Toxicology, and a postgraduate qualification in
                        teaching and learning. I’m a physics teacher by trade. That’s my day job. But Teloshka, this world I’ve
                        built, is my dream. I hope one day I’ll be teaching people about it instead.</p>

                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>What should fantasy do that it often doesn’t?</h3>
                    <p>Fantasy needs to be believable. Too often, it isn’t. We all know the trope when someone dies, then “magic” brings
                        them back without consequence. Think of Jon Snow in Game of Thrones (series). He died, and then he didn’t. It broke
                        the stakes. Compare that with how Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes. Readers left him
                        by the thousands. Fantasy should know when to say “enough.” If someone dies, they stay dead. If they
                        survive, it has to make sense. I bring my science background into my writing. If I can’t imagine something
                        happening under the rules of that world, I won’t write it.</p>
                </article>
            
                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>What are your non-negotiables in writing?</h3>
                    <p>Everything must have a reason. Nothing can exist just to get me out of a plot hole. I actually enjoy writing
                        myself into a corner because it forces me to find a believable way out. If there is no way out, the
                        character doesn’t survive. No sudden rescues unless the story has earned it. If a villain spares a
                        protagonist, it’s not because they monologue, it’s because they need that character alive for a reason. I
                        don’t do cliché villains. Every action, every scene, must serve something bigger than convenience.</p>

                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>What scares you as a writer?</h3>
                    <p>That I get lost in my world, and other people have to hear about it. I can write for days without stopping.
                        That’s not always healthy. I worry that I care too much about getting it all out. But I wouldn’t have it any
                        other way.</p>

                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>Who are you writing for?</h3>
                    <p>This might sound selfish, but I write for me. I love it. I survive to do it. It’s how I get my thoughts out
                        of my head. It’s how I feel free. I cry when I write. I laugh. I cheer, and yes, even when I know what’s coming.
                        That said, I do imagine the reader. I ask, “Would this sentence sound pompous to someone else?” I try to
                        make sure it never feels heavy or difficult to read. I want my writing to be joyful, even when the story
                        isn’t.</p>

                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>What do you want readers to feel when they finish a book?</h3>
                    <p>Relief. Not because it’s over, but because it gave them something. I want them to feel like they’ve been
                        somewhere real. Like it mattered. I try to avoid pompous writing. I want the challenge to be in the story,
                        not the sentence structure. I want people to guess the ending, and still be surprised when it doesn’t go that
                        way.</p>

                    <h3>Why support other authors here?</h3>
                    <p>Indie authors don’t have it easy. Publishers do a lot of the heavy lifting, but they also take a lot in
                        return: control, royalties, sometimes even the voice of the work. Indies have to be better, sharper, and
                        louder. We have to prove ourselves constantly. I want to make space for those writers, because their stories
                        deserve to be seen too.</p>

                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>What do you do when you’re not writing?</h3>
                    <p>I walk and listen to music. Spotify is always on. In fact, I’m building an Essence Wars playlist that matches
                        key moments in Teloshka. I can’t play an instrument, I personally don’t have rhythm, but I can feel music deeply. I also
                        cycle, spend time with my family, and soak up every ounce of spring and sunlight I can. Nature keeps me
                        going.</p>

                <article class="interview-block">
                    <h3>Do you think your best work is ahead of you?</h3>
                    <p>I hope so. I want this feeling to last. I love what I write, but I want to keep getting better. To tell
                        stories that matter, not just in plot, but in how they’re told. If I keep listening to my readers, I’ll keep
                        growing. The moment I stop listening — that’s when my best work will already be behind me.</p>
